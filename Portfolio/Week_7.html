    <h1>Video Game Score Composition Collection</h1>
	<body>
		<h2>Curation Challenges</h2>
		<p>This week, I created a CSS file so as to display the metadata I had implemented within my original MEI file in a clear, concise and helpful manner to any users of my music collection.</p>
		<p>You can find the link to this page (with metadata attached) below, which would be used as the main viewing page for all compositions in my collection.</p>
		<p>You can find a link to my CSS file below as well.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Metadata presented under a <b style="color:blue";>Blue</b> heading refers to who composed the original work, when it was created, and which game it was created for. It also denotes who originally transcribed it for the collection.</p>
		<p>Metadata presented under a <b style="color:red";>Red</b> heading refers to who's added to the original transcription, when they added to it, and which draft of the transcription it is.</p>
		<p>Metadata presented under a <b style="color:green";>Green</b> heading refers to what type of genre of the game the music appears in.</p>
