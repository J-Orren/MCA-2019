    <h1>Video Game Score Composition Collection</h1>
	<body>
			<h2>Musical Datasets</h2>
			<p>As video games play a larger and larger role in society and our pop culture, I think that this sector of musical composition deserves more and more recognition, especially as video games offer the users a much more interactive and immersive experience than almost any other form of media.</p>
			<p>With this in mind, video game composers are faced with the daunting task of not only creating memorable music like those found in film scores, but music that produces a powerful response that adds and magnifies that visceral experience for the user, music which brings the user deeper into the video game world.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Music Datatypes</h3>
			<h4>Acoustic</h4>
			<p>When it comes to the three music datatypes (descriptive, audio, notated) in reference to my collection of music, the most abundant and easy to find datatype is acoustic. Original soundtracks (OST's) of video games can be purchased in all types of formats nowadays, from digitally to vinyl. Then there are the ways of steaming soundtracks through YouTube or Spotify or other streaming services. Although it is easy to find individual albums composed for individual games, it's slightly less easy to find compilations of different video game soundtracks all in one place. Usually YouTube/Spotify/streaming services are better for this kind of content than traditional acoustic purchases (e.g. albums).</p>
			<h4>Descriptive</h4>
			<p>The next most common datatype is probably descriptive. Descriptive data usually will come along with the purchase of an album or an official scorebook, or of course the game itself, but it must be said that there is no guarantee that it will. Descriptive data can also likely be found on online stores/streaming services (e.g. iTunes, Spotify, YouTube etc.).</p>
			<h4>Notated</h4>
			<p>Notated data is most likely the hardest to get a hold of in reference to video game scores. Although it is possible to find official scorebooks of OST's for video games available for purchase, these are quite rare, and definitely not available for every game! Usually if you want to find a notated piece of music from a video game you have to transcribe it yourself or go searching on sites like MuseScore or the like to see if anyone has already transcribed it (however these are very unlikely to be recognised as 'official' scores). </p>
			<br>
			<h3>Analysis of Video Game Scores</h3>
			<p>As far as I can find, there is very little to no analyses of a large scale collection of different video game scores, as there are very few large-scale collections of different video game score compositions.</p>
