			<h2>Similarity and Transcription</h2>
			<h4>Similarity</h4>
			<p>To create my similarity matrix, I used the three songs I've used in previous weeks ("Memories Renewed", "Annalise", and "Nocturno 2") as well as seven other tracks provided on moodle. This matrix can be seen below.</p>
			<p>Tracks 0-3 are classified as part of the "classical" genre. Tracks 4-6, the "rock" genre.</p>
			<p>Tracks 7, 8, and 9 are the ones I named above, and in the same order. Track 7 belongs to the "ambient electronic" genre. Track 8, the "pop" genre. And track 9, the "folk" genre.</p>
			<img src="https://j-orren.github.io/MCA-2019/Week_10/SimilarityMatrix.png" alt="Similarity Matrix" width="500" height="500">
			<p>As you can clearly see from the matrix, the first four songs share quite a very high degree of similarity (which makes sense, they are all from the "classical" genre). The last seven tracks share a reasonably high degree of similarity, though they do not share as much similarity as the first four tracks have to each other (again, this makes sense as they do not belong to one individual genre but to many different types).</p>
			<p>The two least similar tracks are 3 and 8. The two most similar are tracks 0 and 3.</p>
			<p>Out of the three tracks I chose, it follows that track 9 ("Nocturno 2") has the highest degree of similarity to tracks 0-3 (the "classical" tracks), as "folk" music is probably the closest to "classical" when compared to "pop" or "ambient electronic".
			<br>

			<h4>Transcription</h4>
			<p>Next, I was tasked with exporting a MuseScore file into a wav file, transforming this audio into a MIDI file, and then opening this MIDI file back in MuseScore, to see how much data from the original MuseScore file had survived the process of changing through multiple file formats.</p>
			<p>The answer: not much, as can be seen below.</p>

			<h4>Analysis and Comparison</h4>
			<p>As can be clearly seen, not a huge amount of the original data has made it through the process unscathed.</p>
			<p>Tempo has changed from 160 crotchets a minute to 109. The time signature has changed from 12/8 to 3/4 (although this is still not accurate to the original piece, it should be noted that the post-format changes piece has been able to keep a triplet-based time signature). The key signature has drastically changed from G Major/E Minor (1 sharp) to B Major/G# Minor (5 sharps, with a lot of accidental sharps added in). The piece is now only played on a single instrument instead of the 5 in the original score.</p>
			<p>Just visually it is quite easy to see that the post-format changes piece has tried to cram all the midi information in the original piece onto two staves. Although this works in rare instances, it has compromised the piece quite dramatically as a whole, especially in audio form. Listening to both tracks, without the knowledge that the second was transcribed from the first, it would be extremely difficult to realise that the two were related. Although there is a ghost of the original piece still found within the post-format changes file, you have to already be listening for it to perceive it.</p>
