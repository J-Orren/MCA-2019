    <h1>Video Game Score Composition Collection</h1>
	<body>
			<h2>Basic Metadata</h2>
			<p>In this week's task, I focussed on creating a schema to describe the music metadata found within my collection/dataset.</p>
			<p>For my personal collection, I believed the following types of data would be most important for cross-referencing and analysing scores from different video games:</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Title</b> - the title of the track.</p>
			<p><b>Game</b> - the title of the game itself from which the music was composed for.</p>
			<p><b>Composer</b> - the original composer for the score itself.</p>
			<p><b>Year of Composition</b> - the year when the game/composition was released.</p>
			<p><b>Draft</b> - the draft number of transcribed piece of music.</p>
			<p><b>Draft Date</b> - when the current draft was transcribed.</p>
			<p><b>Revised by</b> - the person responsible for transcribing the current draft.</p>
			<p><b>Game Genre</b> - the type of game the music comes from (a survival horror game would most likely have a vastly different score to a first-person shooter for example).</p>
			<br>
			<p>Once I had created my schema, I implemented it into my original MEI file.</p>
